# DocStandard Content Hardening Protocol (Anti-AI & Authority)

## 1. The "Engineering Veteran" Style Guide
To prevent the content from sounding like generic AI fluff, we apply these strict linguistic filters:

- **Ban "AI Transition" Words:** No "In conclusion," "Moreover," "Furthermore," or "Delve."
- **Direct & Technical:** Use active, operational verbs (Ingest, Normalize, Map, Reconcile, Purge).
- **The "Field-Level" Rule:** Every 200 words must include a specific technical field name (e.g., 'HS Code', 'VAT ID', 'GL String', 'Container Check-Digit').
- **Structural Variance:** AI loves lists of 3-5 items. We will use technical mapping tables, logic flowcharts (described in text), and irregular bullet counts to break the pattern.

## 2. Keyword Hardening Pass (Sample from Cluster 1)

| Original Slug | Hardened (High-Intent) Slug | Intent Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/document-processing-services` | `/technical-document-normalization-services` | Shifts from 'scanning' to 'normalization'. |
| `/pdf-data-extraction` | `/pdf-to-erp-data-extraction-logic` | Targets the integration friction. |
| `/unstructured-data-extraction` | `/unstructured-logistics-data-normalization` | Adds the vertical authority. |
| `/document-digitization-services` | `/document-digitization-for-financial-audit` | Adds the 'Audit' E-E-A-T signal. |

## 3. The "Information Gain" Injection
For every post, Leah will pull one "Expert Secret" from memory or the web to add a detail that generic models won't have:
- *Example:* "Mention that carrier-specific accessorial codes (e.g., 'LIFT' for liftgate) must be mapped to the standard GL code '4210' for NetSuite ingestion."
