## Pre-Deploy Checklist (pSEO Pages)

- [ ] All new pages have `noindex` meta tag OR `X-Robots-Tag` header
- [ ] Sitemap only includes URLs that should be indexed
- [ ] 404 URLs removed from sitemap
- [ ] Gatekeeper batch verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Leah (or user) approves before deploy

## Deployment Guardrail

Never deploy pSEO pages automatically. Always:

- [ ] complete this checklist first
- [ ] get explicit human approval before deploy
- [ ] confirm sitemap output and indexability rules in the final review
