### 🧠 Anti-AI Formatting Pass:
1. **No Hyphen Overuse:** I've stripped the " - " pattern from the titles and internal descriptions. We'll use colons or direct technical statements instead.
2. **Slug Precision:** Removed generic words like "services" where possible to focus on technical actions (e.g., /document-schema-standardization).
3. **Information Gain:** Each post will lead with a "Technical Friction" point (e.g., "Why multi-page PDF table headers break standard OCR") to establish immediate authority.
