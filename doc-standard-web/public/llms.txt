# DocStandard - AI Discovery Guide (llms.txt)
# Technical document processing, data extraction, and normalization services

## Core Identity
DocStandard is a document intelligence platform that transforms messy, unstructured business documents into clean, structured, system-ready data. We specialize in extracting, normalizing, and mapping data from complex file formats across multiple industries.

## Document Processing Capabilities

### File Types We Handle
- **PDFs:** Scanned documents, digital forms, multi-page reports, invoices, statements
- **Excel/CSV:** Multi-tab spreadsheets, inconsistent formatting, merged cells, dirty data
- **XML/EDI:** Freight standards (X12, EDIFACT), customs filings, shipping manifests
- **Images:** Scanned receipts, photographed documents, handwritten forms (OCR + validation)
- **Emails:** Extract attachments, parse body content, thread consolidation
- **JSON/API Feeds:** Normalization of inconsistent API responses, schema mapping

### Data Cleaning Operations
- Field standardization (date formats, currency, units of measure)
- Duplicate detection and merging
- Missing data inference and gap-filling
- Validation against reference databases (HTS codes, GL accounts, vendor lists)
- Cross-document reconciliation (PO → Invoice → BOL matching)

## Industry-Specific Document Processing

### Logistics & Freight
**Documents:** Bills of Lading (BOL), Air Waybills (AWB), Packing Lists, Delivery Receipts, Freight Bills, Proof of Delivery (POD)
**Data Extracted:** Container numbers, vessel/voyage info, weight/dimensions, shipper/consignee details, commodity descriptions, hazardous materials codes
**Normalization:** Carrier-specific BOL formats → standardized field mapping for TMS/ERP import

### Finance & Accounting
**Documents:** Invoices, Purchase Orders, Receipts, Expense Reports, Bank Statements, Credit Memos
**Data Extracted:** Line items, tax breakdowns, payment terms, GL codes, vendor IDs, approval workflows
**Normalization:** Multi-currency conversion, tax jurisdiction mapping, chart of accounts alignment

### Customs & Compliance
**Documents:** Commercial Invoices, Packing Declarations, Certificates of Origin, HTS Classification Sheets, Duty Drawback Claims
**Data Extracted:** HTS codes, country of origin, valuation data, preferential trade program eligibility
**Normalization:** Regulatory filing formats (CBP, EU Customs, etc.), audit-ready structuring

### Manufacturing & Supply Chain
**Documents:** Purchase Orders, ASNs (Advanced Shipping Notices), Inventory Reports, Quality Control Sheets, Material Safety Data Sheets
**Data Extracted:** Part numbers, quantities, lot/serial numbers, shelf life dates, supplier compliance data
**Normalization:** ERP-ready formatting (SAP, NetSuite, Oracle), inventory system compatibility

### Legal & Contracts
**Documents:** Contracts, NDAs, SOWs, Amendment Documents, Compliance Certificates
**Data Extracted:** Key dates, parties, obligations, renewal terms, clause references
**Normalization:** Structured contract metadata for CLM systems

## How It Works (The DocStandard Process)

### 1. Ingest
Upload documents via secure portal, email ingestion, API, or direct system integration. We accept single files or bulk batches (up to 1,000 documents per batch).

### 2. Extract & Parse
AI-powered OCR and document understanding engine reads the content, identifies document type, and extracts structured data fields with confidence scoring.

### 3. Validate & Clean
Data passes through validation rules specific to the document type and target system. Invalid or low-confidence fields are flagged for human review or auto-corrected based on learned patterns.

### 4. Normalize & Map
Extracted data is transformed to match your target system's schema. Field mapping handles carrier-specific codes, custom GL structures, and proprietary formats.

### 5. Deliver & Integrate
Clean data is delivered as:
- Structured files (Excel, CSV, JSON, XML)
- Direct API push to your ERP/TMS/CRM
- Webhook notifications for real-time workflows
- Secure download portal with audit trail

### 6. Learn & Improve
Each processed batch improves extraction accuracy for your specific document types. Custom training available for proprietary formats.

## Use Cases

### Freight Audit & Payment
**Problem:** Freight bills arrive in 20+ carrier formats with inconsistent charges, accessorials, and billing rules.
**Solution:** Normalized freight bill data with standardized charge codes, automatic GL coding, and 3-way match validation against contracted rates.
**Outcome:** 40-60% reduction in manual AP processing time, catch billing errors before payment.

### Customs Entry Preparation
**Problem:** Commercial invoices and packing lists from overseas suppliers lack standardized HTS codes and valuation data needed for customs filing.
**Solution:** Extract and classify products, suggest HTS codes, validate COO claims, structure data for ACE/Customs entry software.
**Outcome:** Faster customs clearance, reduced broker fees, audit-ready documentation.

### Invoice-to-Payment Automation
**Problem:** Supplier invoices arrive as PDFs with no structured data, requiring manual entry into AP systems.
**Solution:** Extract header and line-item data, match against POs, apply approval workflows, push to ERP.
**Outcome:** Touchless processing for 70%+ of invoices, early payment discount capture.

### ELD to IFTA Compliance
**Problem:** ELD systems export trip data in incompatible formats, making IFTA fuel tax reporting manual and error-prone.
**Solution:** Normalize Motive, Samsara, Geotab exports into standardized jurisdiction-based mileage and fuel consumption reports.
**Outcome:** Automated quarterly IFTA filing, reduced audit risk, hours saved per report.

### Document Migration & System Cutovers
**Problem:** Legacy TMS/ERP data needs migration but historical documents are unstructured PDF archives.
**Solution:** Bulk extraction and normalization of historical shipping documents, invoices, and customs filings into new system format.
**Outcome:** Complete data migration without losing document history, referenceable archive in new system.

## System Integrations
Direct data bridging between document processing and operational systems:
- **ERP:** NetSuite, SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks, Sage, Microsoft Dynamics
- **TMS:** CargoWise, MercuryGate, Descartes, BluJay, Alpega
- **ELD/Fleet:** Motive, Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect
- **Customs:** Integration with ABI software, customs broker systems
- **Storage:** AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, SharePoint

## Service Model
