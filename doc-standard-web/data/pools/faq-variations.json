  { "question": "Can you handle {{SYSTEM_A}} custom fields and how do you ensure they map correctly to {{SYSTEM_B}}?", "answer": "Yes, we handle custom {{SYSTEM_A}} fields comprehensively. Our process begins with a detailed field mapping session where we document every custom field in your {{SYSTEM_A}} instance, understand its business purpose, and identify the corresponding field or data structure in {{SYSTEM_B}}." },
  { "question": "How do you validate {{SYSTEM_A}} data before sending to {{SYSTEM_B}}, and what happens when validation fails?", "answer": "Our validation process is multi-layered. First, we perform format validation to ensure dates, currencies, and numeric fields match {{SYSTEM_B}}'s expected formats. Second, we verify all reference data—customer codes, vendor IDs, GL accounts—against {{SYSTEM_B}}'s master records to prevent orphaned transactions." },
  { "question": "What file formats do you deliver to {{SYSTEM_B}}?", "answer": "We deliver {{SYSTEM_B}}-ready files in CSV, JSON, or XML formats depending on your import method. Before processing, we confirm your preferred format and any {{SYSTEM_B}}-specific requirements such as column ordering or header naming conventions." },
  { "question": "How fast is turnaround for a {{SYSTEM_A}} to {{SYSTEM_B}} batch?", "answer": "Standard processing time is 24-48 hours for batches up to 10,000 records. For larger batches or complex transformations, we provide timeline estimates during the initial mapping phase. Expedited processing (12-24 hours) is available for urgent {{CITY}} operations." },
  { "question": "How do you handle data security with our {{SYSTEM_A}} exports?", "answer": "Data security is fundamental. All {{SYSTEM_A}} exports are encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3 and encrypted at rest using AES-256. We maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance standards for all {{HUB}} logistics data handling." },
  { "question": "What happens if {{SYSTEM_B}}'s schema changes?", "answer": "Schema changes are common in enterprise systems. When {{SYSTEM_B}}'s schema changes, we update our field mappings and transformation rules to match the new structure, typically requiring only a brief re-validation session." },
  { "question": "Do you support multi-currency normalization in {{SYSTEM_A}}?", "answer": "Yes. Our engine automatically detects and normalizes multi-currency freight charges from {{SYSTEM_A}}, applying current exchange rates and rounding according to {{VAT}} VAT compliance standards." },
  { "question": "Can we automate the {{SYSTEM_A}} to {{SYSTEM_B}} sync?", "answer": "We support both batch and real-time processing models. For real-time synchronization, we can set up API-driven workflows that monitor {{SYSTEM_A}} and immediately process data for {{SYSTEM_B}} ingestion." },
  { "question": "How are {{SYSTEM_A}} HTS codes validated for {{CITY}}?", "answer": "We cross-reference every HTS code in your {{SYSTEM_A}} export against current {{CUSTOMS}} customs tables to ensure filing readiness and reduce compliance risk at {{TERMINAL}}." },
  { "question": "What is the typical error reduction for {{SYSTEM_A}} data?", "answer": "Teams moving data from {{SYSTEM_A}} to {{SYSTEM_B}} typically see a 95-99% reduction in manual entry errors. By automating the extraction and validation at {{HUB}}, we eliminate the 'Data Trap' that leads to reconciliation lag." }
