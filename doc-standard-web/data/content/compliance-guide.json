        "content": "Managing export licenses (BIS, ITAR) or import permits (USDA, FDA) in Excel is a compliance violation waiting to happen. The core friction points are:\n\n1. **License Decrementing Errors:** A license allows 1,000 units. You ship 500, then 600. Without real-time decrementing against the license cap, the second shipment is an illegal export. Excel formulas rarely catch this 'Over-Shipment' risk.\n2. **Expiry Date Anxiety:** Licenses expire. If your system doesn't flag a license that expires *during* the transit time of a shipment, your cargo gets seized at the destination port.\n3. **'End-User' Mismatches:** A license is often specific to a single address. If the Consignee moves their warehouse down the street, the license is invalid. Dumb OCR misses address variations that a compliance officer would catch."
