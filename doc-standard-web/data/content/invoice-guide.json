        "content": "Accounts Payable teams care about one thing: The 3-Way Match (PO vs. Receipt vs. Invoice). Commercial Invoices from overseas vendors break this logic because:\n\n1. **No PO Reference:** Vendors often omit your Purchase Order number on the PDF. Without it, the invoice sits in a 'Mystery Queue' forever. We fuzzy-match line item descriptions to open POs to auto-assign the number.\n2. **Currency Chaos:** The PO was cut in USD ($), but the invoice arrives in EUR (€). Most AP bots fail here. We pull the daily spot rate from your ERP to validate the variance automatically.\n3. **'Miscellaneous' Charges:** Freight, insurance, and packaging fees often appear as extra lines not on the PO. We extract these as 'Non-PO Charges' and code them to specific GL expense accounts automatically."
