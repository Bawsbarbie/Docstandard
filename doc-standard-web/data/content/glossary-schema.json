The '10' refers to ten data elements that importers must file at least 24 hours before cargo is laden aboard a vessel at the foreign port. These elements include manufacturer/supplier name and address, seller name and address, buyer name and address, ship-to name and address, container stuffing location, consolidator name and address, importer of record number, consignee number, country of origin, and commodity HTSUS number. Failure to comply with ISF-10 requirements can result in significant penalties up to $5,000 per violation, cargo holds, and increased inspections.",

Based on the international Harmonized System (HS) maintained by the World Customs Organization, the HTS uses a hierarchical 10-digit code structure to classify products. The first six digits align with international HS codes, while digits 7-10 are U.S.-specific. Accurate HTS classification is critical for determining duty rates, eligibility for free trade agreements, and compliance with import restrictions. Misclassification can result in underpayment or overpayment of duties, penalties, and seizure of goods. Classification requires understanding the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI) and examining product composition, function, and intended use.",
      "technicalContext": "HTS codes are stored in NetSuite custom item fields (custitem_hts_code), SAP Material Master classification views, or Oracle Item Master attributes.

Common status codes include X3 (Arrived at Pickup Location), AF (Departed Pickup Location), X6 (Arrived at Destination), and D1 (Delivered). The document contains hierarchical structure with shipment-level and order-level information, including reference numbers (BOL, PO, PRO), dates and times, location details, and reason codes for delays or exceptions.

In international shipping, this field determines ownership transfer, customs clearance authority, and payment responsibility depending on the Incoterm used. The consignee can be the actual buyer, a bank (in letter of credit transactions), a freight forwarder acting as agent, or a subsidiary of the buying company. For negotiable bills of lading (order bills), the consignee field may show 'To Order' or 'To Order of [Bank]', allowing transfer of title through endorsement. For straight bills, the named consignee is the only party who can receive the goods. Accuracy in this field is critical to prevent delivery disputes and customs delays.",
      "technicalContext": "In CargoWise, the consignee maps to Organization.OrganizationName with Address elements. EDI X.12 304 (Shipping Instructions) and 310 (Freight Receipt) use N1*CN segment for consignee. IDoc segments E1EDKA1 with PARVW=WE (ship-to) or AG (sold-to) map to consignee roles.

The process ensures that the business only pays for goods that were properly ordered (PO validation), actually received (quantity and condition verification), and correctly billed (price and terms validation). Discrepancies in quantity, price, or terms trigger exception handling workflows. Three-way matching is a critical internal control for preventing fraud, reducing overpayments, and maintaining accurate inventory records. In automated ERP systems, this process is handled through matching engines that flag exceptions for manual review while auto-approving matching invoices for payment.",

Unlike ocean bills of lading, an AWB is not a document of title and cannot be transferred through endorsement. The AWB contains 11 digits in three parts: the first 3 digits are the airline prefix (assigned by IATA), followed by an 8-digit serial number and a check digit. There are two types: Master Air Waybill (MAWB) issued by the main carrier to the freight forwarder, and House Air Waybill (HAWB) issued by the freight forwarder to the actual shipper.

The HBL serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, while the forwarder holds a Master Bill of Lading (MBL) with the actual ocean carrier. The shipper and consignee on the HBL reflect the true trading parties, whereas the MBL shows the forwarder as shipper and their agent as consignee. House bills are used in consolidations (LCL shipments) where multiple shippers' cargo is combined into one container, and in forwarding arrangements where the forwarder manages the entire transport chain.

On the MBL, the shipper is typically the freight forwarder or consolidator at origin, and the consignee is the forwarder's agent or branch at destination. The MBL represents the actual contract between the ocean carrier and the party contracting for space. It serves as evidence of receipt of goods, contract of carriage, and in negotiable form, as a document of title. The carrier releases cargo at destination only against surrender of an original negotiable MBL or through telex release authorization.",

Each term specifies: the point at which risk transfers from seller to buyer, which party arranges and pays for transport, export/import clearance responsibilities, and insurance obligations.

      "definition": "A NetSuite RESTlet is a server-side SuiteScript that exposes custom RESTful web services for integration with external systems. RESTlets support GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods and can return data in JSON or XML format. Unlike SuiteTalk SOAP web services, RESTlets provide flexible, custom-tailored endpoints that execute specific business logic within NetSuite. They can perform searches, create/update records, execute saved searches, and trigger workflows. RESTlets authenticate via NLAuth (legacy), OAuth 1.0a, or Token-Based Authentication (TBA). They are deployed with specific script deployments that define access permissions and logging levels. RESTlets are commonly used for real-time integrations where standard SOAP operations are insufficient or where performance optimization is required, offering faster execution than equivalent SOAP calls for complex operations.",

      "definition": "SuiteTalk is NetSuite's SOAP-based web services platform that enables external applications to access NetSuite data and business processes using standard web service protocols. It supports record CRUD operations (get, add, update, delete, upsert), saved search execution, and asynchronous processing. SuiteTalk uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) definitions that describe available operations and data types. The platform supports token-based authentication (TBA) and SAML single sign-on for secure access. SuiteTalk handles complex record types including Transactions (Sales Orders, Invoices, Bills), Entities (Customers, Vendors), Custom Records, and Item records. It provides synchronous and asynchronous operation modes, with the latter used for large data volumes to avoid timeouts. SuiteTalk is ideal for batch integrations and scenarios requiring strict schema adherence.",

Authentication: Passport (email/password - deprecated), TokenPassport (TBA with consumer key/secret, token key/secret). RecordRef objects reference records by internalId, externalId, or name. SOAP headers include: passport/tokenPassport, searchPreferences (pageSize, bodyFieldsOnly), preferences (warningAsError, disableMandatoryCustomFieldValidation).

Unlike user-visible record names or numbers, the InternalID is an immutable integer that permanently identifies a record regardless of changes to other fields. When integrating external systems with NetSuite, InternalIDs are required for referencing existing records in SuiteTalk SOAP and RESTlet operations. ExternalID is an optional alternative identifier that allows external systems to use their own unique keys when creating NetSuite records. Using ExternalID enables idempotent operations - the same request can be sent multiple times without creating duplicates, as NetSuite matches on ExternalID. Best practices recommend maintaining cross-reference tables mapping external system IDs to NetSuite InternalIDs for optimal integration performance and reliability.",
