        "content": "Most importers try to classify goods by searching a keyword (e.g., 'Drone') in the HTSUS book. This fails because legal classification is based on **'Essential Character' (GRI 3b)**, not marketing names.\n\n**Example:** A 'Drone with Camera'.\n- Is it an Aircraft (Chapter 88)?\n- Is it a Camera (Chapter 85)?\n- **The Rule:** If the camera is the primary function, it's 8525. If it's for flying, it's 8806. A wrong choice changes the duty rate from 0% to 25%. Our engine traces the GRI logic step-by-step."
