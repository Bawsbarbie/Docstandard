        "title": "Why Direct TMS-to-ERP Syncs Fail: The Operational Reality",
        "content": "Most logistics providers assume that enabling an API or XML export between their TMS (CargoWise, MercuryGate) and their ERP (SAP, NetSuite) is a 'plug-and-play' operation. In reality, direct syncs fail 40% of the time due to 'Data Friction'—unstructured, inconsistent, or invalid data that the ERP rejects. Key bottlenecks include: \n\n1. **XML Encoding & Schema Mismatches:** CargoWise eAdapter exports often contain character sets or nested XML structures that rigid ERP schemas (like SAP S/4HANA) cannot parse without custom middleware. \n2. **UOM (Unit of Measure) Desync:** A TMS might record a shipment in 'PLT' (Pallets), while the ERP requires 'EA' (Each) or a specific ISO code. Without normalization, these invoices trigger manual reconciliation alerts.\n3. **Multi-Currency Rounding Errors:** When processing international freight across 50+ documents, rounding differences at the line-item level between TMS accruals and ERP actuals lead to 'Penny-Gap' audit failures."

Instead of pushing raw, dirty data into your ERP, we perform a 3-step normalization process: \n\n1. **Extraction & Validation:** Our engine extracts every line item from your TMS PDF or XML exports, identifying missing reference numbers or invalid HS codes immediately.\n2. **Cross-System Alignment:** We apply your specific business logic (e.g., 'If Carrier = X, then GL Code = Y') to every record in the batch.\n3. **System-Ready Output:** We deliver a clean, validated CSV or JSON payload that is guaranteed to clear your ERP's validation rules on the first try."
