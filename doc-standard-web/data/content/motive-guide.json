        "content": "Most fleets assume Motive's raw GPS export is 'IFTA-Ready'. It's not. Raw ELD data contains gaps that trigger audit penalties:\n\n1. **GPS Drift & 'Jumping':** When a truck enters a tunnel or dense urban canyon, GPS points 'jump'. A 5-mile trip suddenly looks like 50 miles. Without smoothing algorithms, your mileage totals are inflated, and you overpay tax.\n2. **Private Yard Moves:** Miles driven inside a private yard (unladen) are often exempt from IFTA. Raw logs count every wheel turn. We filter 'On-Property' vs 'Highway' miles automatically.\n3. **Fuel Card Mismatches:** A driver buys fuel in Ohio but the ELD says the truck was in Kentucky (border crossing issue). Auditors flag this instantly. We cross-reference Fuel Card timestamps with GPS pings to validate every gallon."

        "content": "- **The 'Leak':** Fleets often overpay IFTA by 3-7% because they don't exclude exempt miles (off-road, private roads, toll road exemptions).\n- **The Fix:** Our geospatial filtering removes non-taxable miles from the report automatically.\n- **Value:** For a 50-truck fleet, this recovers ~$15,000/year in unnecessary tax payments."
