# SNDA Agreement Processing: Subordination Documentation

**"SNDAs protect lenders from lease term interference. Incomplete documentation creates foreclosure risk. Precise processing protects collateral."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreements (SNDAs) govern lender and tenant rights in foreclosure. Lenders require SNDAs from major tenants. Tenants negotiate specific protections. Each SNDA is unique. Tracking execution status, recording, and compliance across loan portfolios requires organized documentation.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Execution Tracking:** SNDAs negotiated, drafted, and sent for signature. Tracking which tenants have executed, which are pending, and which resist is critical
* **Recording Verification:** Recorded SNDAs protect lender rights. Unrecorded SNDAs may be junior to intervening liens
* **Term Variation:** SNDAs vary in non-disturbance protections, attornment requirements, and estoppel certificate obligations

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process SNDA documentation into complete collateral files with execution tracking, recording confirmation, and term summary.

### Processing Standards:
* **SNDA Tracking:** Each agreement tracked with `Tenant_Name`, `Lease_Date`, `SNDA_Status` (Draft, Out_for_Signature, Executed, Recorded), and `Effective_Date`
* **Recording Verification:** Recorded SNDAs verified with `Recording_Date`, `Book_Page`, `Instrument_Number`, and `County_Recorder_Confirmation`
* **Term Extraction:** Key provisions identified: `Non_Disturbance_Scope`, `Attornment_Obligation`, `Estoppel_Requirements`, `Notice_Provisions`

## ROI for Collateral Management
Missing SNDAs can subordinate lender interests to tenant rights in foreclosure, reducing recovery. Complete documentation preserves collateral value.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Execution Visibility:** Clear status tracking ensures no tenant overlooked
2. **Recording Confirmation:** Verified recording protects priority position
3. **Term Awareness:** Extracted provisions inform foreclosure strategy
