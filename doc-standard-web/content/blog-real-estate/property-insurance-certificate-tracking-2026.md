# Property Insurance Certificate Tracking: Coverage Verification

**"Insurance certificates prove coverage. Lapsed coverage creates liability. Tracking certificates across portfolios requires systematic organization."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Property owners and lenders require insurance coverage on real estate. Tenants maintain liability coverage. Contractors carry workers comp and general liability. Tracking certificates of insurance (COIs) across hundreds of properties and tenants is complex. Expired coverage, inadequate limits, and non-compliant additional insured provisions create risk.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Expiration Tracking:** Certificates expire annually (sometimes more frequently). Tracking expiration dates across portfolios prevents coverage gaps
* **Limit Verification:** Policies must meet minimum limits ($1M, $2M, $5M). Certificate review confirms compliance
* **Additional Insured Compliance:** Lenders and landlords require additional insured status. Certificate must show proper endorsement

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process insurance certificates into managed coverage tracking with expiration alerts, limit verification, and compliance confirmation.

### Processing Standards:
* **Certificate Extraction:** All COI data captured: `Named_Insured`, `Policy_Number`, `Policy_Type`, `Carrier`, `Effective_Date`, `Expiration_Date`, `Limits`, `Deductible`
* **Requirement Comparison:** Certificate coverage compared against `Required_Limits`, `Required_Coverage_Types`, and `Additional_Insured_Requirements`
* **Expiration Management:** All policies tracked with `Days_Until_Expiration`, `Renewal_Requested_Date`, and `Compliance_Status`

## ROI for Risk Management
Uninsured losses on real estate can reach millions. A fire at an inadequately insured property creates total loss exposure. Systematic tracking ensures coverage exists when needed.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Coverage Verification:** Confirmed compliance with insurance requirements
2. **Expiration Prevention:** Proactive renewal tracking prevents lapses
3. **Additional Insured Protection:** Proper endorsement documentation supports claim rights
