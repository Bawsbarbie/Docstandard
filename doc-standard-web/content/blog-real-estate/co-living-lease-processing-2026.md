# Co-Living Lease Processing: Shared Housing Documentation

**"Co-living leases combine individual and shared space rights. Documentation must address unique allocation, access, and responsibility issues."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Co-living and shared housing models lease private bedrooms with shared common areas. Leases differ from traditional apartments. Space allocation, common area rights, and responsibility sharing require specific documentation. House rules, roommate matching, and turnover management add complexity.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Space Allocation:** Private bedroom SF vs common area SF. Individual vs shared amenities. Allocation affects pricing and rights
* **Responsibility Sharing:** Cleaning, supplies, noise, guests. Rules must be clear and enforceable
* **Turnover Management:** Individual room turnover with continuing common area leases requires documentation coordination

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process co-living leases into structured documentation with clear allocation, defined responsibilities, and coordinated turnover provisions.

### Processing Standards:
* **Space Definition:** All space clearly allocated: `Private_Bedroom_SF`, `Private_Bath_Flag`, `Common_Area_SF`, `Common_Amenities`, `Allocation_Methodology`
* **Responsibility Documentation:** Rules and obligations specified: `Cleaning_Schedule`, `Supply_Sharing`, `Guest_Policy`, `Noise_Hours`, `Common_Area_Use`
* **Turnover Coordination:** Individual lease terms tracked: `Room_Lease_Start`, `Room_Lease_End`, `Common_Lease_Term`, `Replacement_Roommate_Rights`

## ROI for Co-Living Operations
Unclear co-living documentation creates disputes, turnover, and operational friction. Systematic documentation supports smooth operations and resident satisfaction.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Allocation Clarity:** Clear space definition prevents usage disputes
2. **Rule Certainty:** Documented responsibilities support enforcement
3. **Turnover Efficiency:** Coordinated documentation enables individual room turns
