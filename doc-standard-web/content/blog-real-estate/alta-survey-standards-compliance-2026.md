# ALTA Survey Standards Compliance: Survey Review Processing

**"ALTA surveys meet rigorous standards. Reviewing them for compliance requires systematic checking of Table A items and exception verification."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
ALTA/NSPS Land Title Surveys provide comprehensive property information for commercial transactions. They meet detailed standards for boundary location, improvement measurement, and exception identification. Table A optional items add specific requirements. Reviewing surveys for compliance, completeness, and title alignment is technical work.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Table A Verification:** Optional items (utilities, wetlands, access, zoning) must be checked for inclusion when ordered
* **Exception Comparison:** Survey findings must be compared against title commitment exceptions for resolution or acceptance
* **Standard Compliance:** ALTA standards specify precision, certification, and content requirements that must be verified

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process ALTA surveys into compliance-verified review packages with Table A checking, exception comparison, and standard verification.

### Processing Standards:
* **Table A Review:** All ordered optional items verified for inclusion and completeness: `Utility_Locations`, `Plotted_Easements`, `Zoning_Classification`, `Flood_Zone`, `Access`
* **Exception Alignment:** Survey findings compared against `Schedule_B_Exceptions` with `Resolved`, `Acceptable`, or `Requires_Curative` status
* **Standard Verification:** Survey checked for `2016_ALTA_Compliance`, `Surveyor_Certification`, `Boundary_Measurement_Precision`, and `Improvement_Location`

## ROI for Survey Review
Incomplete or non-compliant surveys require revision or supplemental work, causing 1-2 week delays. Systematic review identifies issues before closing deadlines.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Compliance Confirmation:** Verified adherence to ALTA standards and Table A requirements
2. **Exception Resolution:** Clear alignment between survey findings and title exceptions
3. **Revision Prevention:** Early identification of survey deficiencies enables correction
