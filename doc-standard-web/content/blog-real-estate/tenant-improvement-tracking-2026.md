# Tenant Improvement Allowance Tracking: Construction Management

**"TI allowances are major lease concessions. Tracking draw requests, invoices, and completion requires organized documentation."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Commercial leases often include tenant improvement (TI) allowances. Landlords fund tenant construction up to a specified amount. Tracking requires documentation: lease terms, work letters, contractor bids, draw requests, invoices, lien waivers, and completion certificates. Disorganized tracking leads to over-payment or payment disputes.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Allowance Balance Confusion:** Original allowance minus previous draws minus pending invoices equals remaining balance. Multiple spreadsheets create version confusion
* **Documentation Requirements:** Each draw requires invoices, lien waivers, and proof of completion. Requirements vary by lease
* **Completion Verification:** Determining when work is substantially complete triggers different payment obligations than final completion

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process TI documentation into managed allowance tracking with verified balances, complete draw packages, and clear completion status.

### Processing Standards:
* **Allowance Tracking:** Original `TI_Allowance`, `Draws_To_Date`, `Pending_Draws`, `Remaining_Balance` tracked with `As_Of_Date` and `Verification_Status`
* **Draw Documentation:** All draw requests verified for `Invoice_Amount`, `Work_Complete`, `Lien_Waivers`, and `Allowance_Availability`
* **Completion Status:** Work tracked by phase: `Not_Started`, `In_Progress`, `Substantially_Complete`, `Final_Completion` with `Certificate_Of_Occupancy` linkage

## ROI for Allowance Management
TI over-payments are rarely recoverable. Systematic tracking prevents over-payment and documents proper fund disbursement for audit purposes.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Balance Accuracy:** Real-time allowance tracking prevents over-commitment
2. **Documentation Completeness:** Required documents verified before each draw
3. **Completion Clarity:** Phase tracking ensures proper payment timing
