# Pro Forma Financial Modeling: Projection Standardization

**"Pro formas project investment returns. Inconsistent assumptions and formats make comparison impossible. Standardization enables analysis."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Real estate investors rely on pro forma financial projections to evaluate acquisitions and developments. Pro formas are built in Excel with varying structures, time periods, and assumptions. Comparing a 5-year monthly model to a 10-year annual model requires reconstruction. Assumption differences (growth rates, vacancy, cap rates) aren't always explicit.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Structure Variation:** Some models show monthly periods, some annual. Some run 5 years, some 10. Rows and columns arranged differently in every file
* **Assumption Burial:** Key assumptions embedded in formulas rather than clearly stated in assumption tables
* **Hardcoded Values:** Growth rates, vacancy rates, and other variables hardcoded in cells rather than linked to assumption sections

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process pro forma models into standardized projections with consistent structure, explicit assumptions, and formula-linked variables.

### Processing Standards:
* **Structure Normalization:** All models follow standard layout: `Assumptions`, `Income`, `Expenses`, `NOI`, `Debt_Service`, `Cash_Flow`, `Returns` with consistent row and column organization
* **Assumption Extraction:** All assumptions moved to front section: `Purchase_Price`, `Closing_Costs`, `Capital_Improvements`, `Rent_Growth`, `Expense_Growth`, `Exit_Cap_Rate`
* **Formula Verification:** All calculations verified for consistency: `NOI` = `Income` - `Expenses`. `Cash_Flow` = `NOI` - `Debt_Service`. `IRR` calculated properly

## ROI for Investment Analysis
Reconstructing non-standard models takes 4-8 hours each. Standardization enables immediate comparison and analysis. A firm evaluating 50 opportunities annually saves 200-400 hours.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Immediate Comparison:** Standard format enables side-by-side opportunity comparison
2. **Assumption Clarity:** Explicit assumptions enable sensitivity analysis
3. **Formula Confidence:** Verified calculations reduce model error risk
