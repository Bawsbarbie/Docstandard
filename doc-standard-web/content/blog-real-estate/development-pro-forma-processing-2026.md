# Development Pro Forma Processing: Project Feasibility Analysis

**"Development pro formas are complex. Land cost, hard cost, soft cost, financing, lease-up, exit. Organized data enables decision-making."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Real estate development requires detailed financial analysis. Land acquisition, construction costs, financing, leasing, and disposition must be modeled. Development pro formas are more complex than acquisition pro formas. Time periods are monthly during construction then annual during operation. Multiple cost categories require detailed tracking.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Cost Category Fragmentation:** Hard costs, soft costs, land costs, and carrying costs tracked in different worksheets or files without consolidation
* **Timing Complexity:** Construction draws, lease-up periods, and stabilization create variable cash flows that are hard to model consistently
* **Sensitivity Analysis Difficulty:** Key variables (construction cost, lease rates, absorption) buried in formulas, preventing quick scenario testing

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process development pro formas into structured feasibility analyses with consolidated costs, clear timelines, and accessible assumptions.

### Processing Standards:
* **Cost Consolidation:** All costs organized: `Land_Cost`, `Hard_Costs`, `Soft_Costs`, `Financing_Costs`, `Carrying_Costs` with `Per_Unit` and `Per_SF` metrics
* **Timeline Structuring:** Development phases defined: `Land_Closing`, `Permitting`, `Construction_Start`, `Certificate_of_Occupancy`, `Stabilization` with monthly cash flows
* **Sensitivity Enablement:** Key variables isolated in assumption section: `Construction_Cost_Per_SF`, `Market_Rent_Per_Unit`, `Absorption_Rate`, `Exit_Cap_Rate`

## ROI for Development Decisions
Development commitments involve millions in risk. Pro forma errors (underestimating costs, overestimating rents) create project failure. Clean data enables sound decisions.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Cost Visibility:** Consolidated categories reveal true project cost structure
2. **Timeline Clarity:** Phased cash flows show funding requirements and return timing
3. **Scenario Testing:** Isolated assumptions enable quick sensitivity analysis
