# Purchase Agreement Field Mapping for Brokerages: Deal Management

**"Purchase agreements are complex contracts with 50+ data points. Managing dozens of active deals requires structured data, not PDFs."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Real estate brokerages handle dozens of simultaneous transactions. Each purchase agreement contains critical data: parties, property, price, dates, contingencies. Most brokerages store PDFs without extracting data. Finding active deals closing this week, or deals with inspection contingencies expiring, requires reading files manually.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Data Silos:** Purchase agreements in transaction management systems as attachments without extractable data fields
* **Date Tracking Chaos:** `Closing_Date`, `Inspection_Contingency_Date`, `Financing_Contingency_Date`, and `Appraisal_Contingency_Date` tracked inconsistently
* **Party Confusion:** Buyer names, seller names, and agent information scattered across document pages without standardized fields

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process purchase agreements into structured deal databases with extracted parties, dates, terms, and contingency tracking.

### Processing Standards:
* **Party Extraction:** All parties identified: `Buyer_Name`, `Buyer_Address`, `Seller_Name`, `Seller_Address`, `Listing_Agent`, `Buyer_Agent`, `Brokerage_Name`
* **Property Identification:** `Property_Address`, `Parcel_Number`, `Legal_Description`, and `Property_Type` extracted and verified
* **Term Structuring:** `Purchase_Price`, `Earnest_Money`, `Closing_Date`, and all contingency deadlines extracted to date fields

## ROI for Brokerage Operations
A 50-agent brokerage handling 600 transactions annually wastes 15-20 minutes per deal re-keying data into multiple systems. Systematic extraction eliminates that waste.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Pipeline Visibility:** All active deal data searchable and reportable
2. **Deadline Management:** Automated alerts for contingency expirations and closing dates
3. **Commission Tracking:** Structured party data feeds accounting systems
