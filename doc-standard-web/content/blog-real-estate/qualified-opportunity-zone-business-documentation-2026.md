# Qualified Opportunity Zone Business Documentation: Operating Compliance

**"QOZB documentation proves business operations qualify for Opportunity Zone benefits. Organized records support tax positions and investor reporting."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Opportunity Zone Funds can invest in Qualified Opportunity Zone Businesses (QOZBs). These operating businesses must meet specific requirements: substantial portion of income from Zone, substantial portion of intangible property used in Zone, and substantial portion of tangible property in Zone. Documentation must prove ongoing compliance.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Income Sourcing:** QOZB must derive 50%+ income from Zone activity. Revenue tracking and geographic allocation requires systematic documentation
* **Property Usage:** 70%+ of tangible property must be in Zone. Asset tracking and location verification required
* **Investor Reporting:** Fund investors need regular reporting on investment status, compliance, and projected tax benefits

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process QOZB documentation into compliance-demonstrated records with income sourcing, property tracking, and investor reporting.

### Processing Standards:
* **Income Tracking:** Revenue sourced by location: `Zone_Revenue`, `Non_Zone_Revenue`, `Percentage_Zone`, `50_Percent_Test_Status`
* **Property Documentation:** Tangible property tracked: `Asset_List`, `Location_Address`, `Zone_Status`, `Percentage_in_Zone`, `70_Percent_Test_Status`
* **Investor Reporting:** Regular reports generated: `Investment_Balance`, `Compliance_Status`, `Tax_Benefit_Projection`, `Substantial_Improvement_Progress`

## ROI for Fund Management
QOZB non-compliance jeopardizes Fund qualification and investor tax benefits. Systematic documentation enables proactive compliance management.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Compliance Demonstration:** Organized records prove ongoing qualification
2. **Test Monitoring:** Regular calculation shows trending toward/away from thresholds
3. **Investor Confidence:** Regular reporting supports investor relations and capital raising
