# Deed Processing and Recording: County Filing Standards

**"Deeds must record to transfer ownership. County recorders reject non-compliant documents. Rejections delay closings and create liability."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Real estate deeds must meet county recorder requirements to be accepted for recording. Format, margins, font size, notarization, and legal description standards vary by jurisdiction. Title companies prepare deeds from title search information. Errors in grantor/grantee names, property descriptions, or formatting cause rejections.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Grantor/Grantee Name Variation:** Vesting deed shows "John A. Smith and Mary B. Smith, husband and wife." Current transaction involves "John A. Smith, a single man." Name consistency issues create chain gaps
* **Legal Description Defects:** Metes and bounds descriptions with omitted calls, incorrect distances, or ambiguous references
* **Formatting Non-Compliance:** Margins too small, font too small, or missing required affidavits for specific counties

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process deeds for recording with verified parties, validated legal descriptions, and jurisdiction-compliant formatting.

### Processing Standards:
* **Party Verification:** Grantor names verified against `Vesting_Deed`, `Title_Search`, and `Identification_Documents` with `Name_Variance_Report`
* **Legal Description Validation:** Descriptions checked for `Completeness`, `Closure` (metes and bounds), and `Parcel_ID_Match` against tax records
* **Format Compliance:** Documents formatted to county requirements: `Margin_Size`, `Font_Size`, `Page_Size`, `Required_Affidavits`

## ROI for Title Operations
Recording rejections delay closings, upset borrowers and sellers, and create scheduling nightmares. Same-day recording requires first-submittal acceptance.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **First-Submittal Recording:** Compliance-checked documents accepted without rejection
2. **Chain Integrity:** Verified party names maintain clear title chain
3. **Legal Certainty:** Validated descriptions ensure property identification accuracy
