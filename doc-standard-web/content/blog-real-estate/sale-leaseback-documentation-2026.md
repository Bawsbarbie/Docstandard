# Sale-Leaseback Documentation: Transaction Structuring

**"Sale-leasebacks free capital while maintaining operations. Documentation must balance sale terms and lease terms for both parties."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Sale-leaseback transactions involve simultaneous property sale and leaseback to seller. Documentation serves dual purposes. Purchase and sale agreement governs sale. Lease governs occupancy. Terms must align (closing timing, rent commencement, condition standards). Inconsistencies create post-closing disputes.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Term Alignment:** Sale closing date must align with lease commencement. Rent must align with purchase price to achieve target returns
* **Condition Standards:** Sale condition standards may differ from lease maintenance obligations. Documentation must clarify
* **Tax Treatment:** Sale-leasebacks can be structured as true leases or financing transactions. Documentation must support intended treatment

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process sale-leaseback documentation into aligned transaction packages with term verification, consistency checking, and treatment support.

### Processing Standards:
* **Term Alignment:** Sale and lease terms cross-referenced: `Closing_Date` = `Lease_Commencement`, `Purchase_Price` and `Rent` support `Target_Return`, `Condition_Requirements` align
* **Document Consistency:** PSA and lease provisions checked for conflict: `Use_Restrictions`, `Alterations`, `Maintenance`, `Insurance`, `Defaults`
* **Treatment Documentation:** Documents structured to support `True_Lease` or `Financing` treatment with `Economic_Substance` and `Risk_Transfer` analysis

## ROI for Transaction Execution
Inconsistent sale-leaseback documentation causes closing delays and post-closing disputes. Systematic processing ensures clean execution.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Closing Coordination:** Aligned terms enable simultaneous closing and commencement
2. **Conflict Prevention:** Consistent documentation eliminates interpretive disputes
3. **Treatment Support:** Proper structure supports intended accounting and tax treatment
