# Ground Lease Processing: Land Lease Documentation

**"Ground leases are unique. Rent resets, reversion rights, and improvement ownership create complexity. Organized documentation enables proper management."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Ground leases (land leases) differ from space leases. The tenant owns improvements and leases the land. Rent resets, mortgagee protections, and reversion provisions create unique documentation needs. Ground lease terms run 50-99 years. Tracking reset dates, appraisals, and mortgagee notice requirements across decades requires systematic organization.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Rent Reset Complexity:** Ground leases reset rent based on appraisals, CPI, or fixed steps. Reset timing and methodology vary
* **Mortgagee Protection:** Ground lease lenders require notice rights, cure rights, and new lease protections. Documentation must be complete
* **Reversion Planning:** Lease end means improvement reversion to landlord. Remaining term tracking informs investment and financing decisions

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process ground lease documentation into managed lease files with reset tracking, mortgagee protection verification, and reversion timeline management.

### Processing Standards:
* **Reset Tracking:** All rent resets documented with `Reset_Date`, `Reset_Methodology` (Appraisal, CPI, Fixed), `Appraisal_Requirements`, and `Notice_Period`
* **Mortgagee Protection:** Lender rights documented: `Notice_Rights`, `Cure_Rights`, `New_Lease_Election`, `Non_Disturbance`, `SNDA_Status`
* **Reversion Timeline:** `Lease_Expiration`, `Remaining_Term`, `Reversion_Rights`, `Removal_Obligations`, and `Termination_Notice_Deadline` tracked

## ROI for Ground Lease Management
Missed rent reset notices or lease expirations create substantial financial exposure. Systematic tracking prevents costly oversights.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Reset Preparation:** Advance notice enables appraisal scheduling and negotiation
2. **Lender Protection:** Complete documentation supports financing and foreclosure rights
3. **Term Visibility:** Remaining term tracking informs investment and development decisions
