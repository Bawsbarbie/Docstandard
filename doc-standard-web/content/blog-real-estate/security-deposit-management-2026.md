# Security Deposit Management: Trust Fund Compliance

**"Security deposits are tenant funds held in trust. Regulatory compliance requires specific handling, documentation, and accounting. Errors create liability."**

## The Real Estate Data Problem
Property managers hold security deposits on behalf of tenants. State laws govern deposit handling, interest calculation, return timing, and documentation. Deposits must be held in segregated accounts. Interest must be calculated and credited. Disposition at move-out requires itemized accounting. Non-compliance exposes landlords to penalties and lawsuits.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Account Segregation:** Deposits commingled with operating funds violate most state laws. Tracking which deposits are in which accounts is challenging
* **Interest Calculation:** Interest rates vary by state, year, and account type. Calculating accrued interest for each tenant manually is error-prone
* **Disposition Documentation:** Move-out accounting requires itemized deductions with supporting documentation. Incomplete records invite tenant disputes

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process security deposit records into compliant tracking with segregated accounting, verified interest calculations, and complete disposition documentation.

### Processing Standards:
* **Account Tracking:** Each deposit tracked with `Deposit_Amount`, `Account_Number`, `Deposit_Date`, `Interest_Rate`, `Accrued_Interest`, and `Total_Balance`
* **Interest Calculation:** Interest calculated per state requirements with `Calculation_Method`, `Rate_Source`, `Period_Start`, `Period_End`, and `Interest_Amount`
* **Disposition Documentation:** Move-out accounting includes `Move_Out_Date`, `Inspection_Date`, `Deduction_Items` with `Description`, `Amount`, and `Receipt_Attachment`

## ROI for Deposit Compliance
Security deposit violations trigger statutory penalties (2-3x deposit amount in many states) plus attorney fees. On a $2,000 deposit, that's $4,000-6,000 exposure. Systematic compliance prevents violations.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Segregation Compliance:** Account tracking proves proper deposit handling
2. **Interest Accuracy:** Calculated per regulatory requirements
3. **Disposition Support:** Complete documentation defends deduction claims
