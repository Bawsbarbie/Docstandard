# Automated Extraction Error Resolution: The Human in the Loop Protocol (2026)

In document processing, 100% accuracy is the goal, but 99.9% is the reality. The difference between a "Broken Workflow" and an "Elite Operation" is how you handle that 0.1%. Automated extraction error resolution is the framework for identifying, flagging, and correcting mapping exceptions before they contaminate your production database.

DocStandard integrates an "Exception Management" layer that ensures no error ever reaches your ERP.

## The Danger of Silent Failures

A "Silent Failure" occurs when an extraction tool makes a mistake but doesn't trigger an alert. For example, a system might misread a "5" as an "8" on a blurry scan, resulting in a $3,000 billing error. If your system doesn't have an error-resolution protocol, this mistake won't be found until the audit—months too late.

DocStandard logic identifies "Low-Confidence Fields" and "Logic Violations" (e.g., an invoice date in the future) and isolates them for immediate review.

### Error Resolution Benchmarks:
* **Deterministic Flagging:** Automatically isolating any document where the mathematical cross-check fails (e.g., line items != total).
* **Self-Healing Field Logic:** Using master data reference lists to "Auto-Correct" known variations (e.g., mapping "FedEx Grnd" and "FedEx Ground" to a single carrier ID).
* **Operational Queueing:** Sending exception-only files to a dedicated dashboard queue for rapid "Human-in-the-Loop" verification.

## Turning Exceptions into Insights

Every extraction error is a signal. By tracking *why* certain documents fail (e.g., a specific vendor's printer is always blurry), you can fix the problem at the source. DocStandard provides the reporting needed to move from "Fixing Errors" to "Optimizing Ingestion."

### Strategic Advantages:
1. **100% Data Integrity:** Knowing that every record in your ERP has passed through a rigorous error-resolution gate.
2. **Reduced Labor Overhead:** Only reviewing the 0.1% of files that actually need attention, rather than 100% of the batch.
3. **Continuous Logic Improvement:** Feeding resolution data back into our engine to improve extraction accuracy for your specific document types.

By mastering automated error resolution, DocStandard provides the safety net needed for high-speed document processing.
