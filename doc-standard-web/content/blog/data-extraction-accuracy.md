# Data Extraction Accuracy: The Binary Standard for Global Finance (2026)

In document processing, accuracy is not a sliding scale; it is a binary state. In high-stakes B2B workflows like accounts payable and customs compliance, a "95% accuracy rate" is a systemic failure. An error in an `Invoice_Total` or a `HTS_Code` results in financial overpayments or regulatory holds. High-integrity data requires an extraction accuracy protocol that prioritizes deterministic mapping over AI-based guessing.

DocStandard provides the technical authority needed to deliver 100% validated extraction for every ingested batch.

## The Failure of Probabilistic Extraction

Generic OCR tools rely on "Confidence Scores." If the system is 80% sure a number is a "3," it passes it through. This "Uncertainty Tax" forces your team to manually verify every single field, defeating the purpose of automation.

DocStandard replaces "Confidence" with "Logic." We use anchor-based semantic mapping and relational cross-checks to ensure that every data point is mathematically and contextually accurate before it is delivered.

### Accuracy Logic Benchmarks:
* **Relational Field Verification:** Ensuring that the extracted `Tax_Amount` and `Net_Weight` are logically consistent with the `Invoice_Subtotal` and `Packaging_Type`.
* **Checksum Algorithms:** Automatically validating bank IDs, container check-digits, and VAT numbers before the record is accepted as "Correct."
* **Historical Logic Comparisons:** Checking extracted values against your historical data to flag "Outlier" values that indicate a potential mapping error.

## Transitioning to "Audit-Ready" Data Batches

Our $799 Standard Batch is designed for organizations that cannot afford a data error. We provide the enterprise-grade extraction needed to process 2,000 pages of operational history without the "Data Drift" seen in cheap AI tools.

### Operational Outcomes:
1. **Touchless ERP Posting:** Data that is so reliable it can trigger automated payments in your AP workflow.
2. **Reduced Manual Triage:** Eliminating the need for "Data Cleanup" teams to fix extraction errors.
3. **Data Integrity Trust:** Building a "Trusted Data Pipeline" where your systems can operate on normalized, validated facts.

By prioritizing field extraction accuracy, DocStandard provides the technical bridge needed to automate your back office.
