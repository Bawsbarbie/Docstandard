# Trial Exhibit Presentation Systems: Courtroom Technology

**"Technology failures in trial are disasters. Juries remember the crash, not the evidence. Presentation systems need to just work."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Modern trials use technology for exhibit presentation. Screens, projectors, annotation tools. Exhibits need to be in formats that display properly, load quickly, and annotate cleanly. Wrong formats cause delays, crashes, and jury distraction. Technical problems undermine professional presentation.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Format Compatibility:** High-resolution exhibits crash presentation software. Scanned documents look blurry on screens. Spreadsheets don't format for display
* **Load Time Delays:** Large video files or complex animations take too long to load, creating dead air in trial
* **Annotation Failure:** Static PDFs don't allow real-time highlighting and marking that modern juries expect

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process trial exhibits into presentation-optimized formats with resolution balancing, load optimization, and annotation capabilities.

### Processing Standards:
* **Resolution Optimization:** Images processed to 150 DPI for screen display (sharp but not bloated). Documents OCR'd for text search during presentation
* **Load Optimization:** Video files compressed to H.264 format with `Resolution`, `Bitrate`, and `Duration` logged for timing planning
* **Annotation Preparation:** All exhibits converted to annotation-compatible format with `Exhibit_ID` watermark and `Presentation_Notes` field

## ROI for Trial Presentation
Technical failures during trial create delays, frustrate judges, and distract juries. Professional presentation technology supports credibility and keeps focus on evidence.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Reliable Display:** Formats tested for courtroom technology compatibility
2. **Smooth Transitions:** Optimized file sizes eliminate load delays
3. **Interactive Presentation:** Annotation capabilities enable dynamic evidence exploration
