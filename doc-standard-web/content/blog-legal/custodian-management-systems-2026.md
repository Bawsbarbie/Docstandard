# Custodian Management Systems: Personnel Data Tracking

**"Custodians are your primary data sources. Managing them poorly means missing documents or over-collecting. Both are expensive."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Litigation holds target custodians (people with relevant documents). Each custodian has multiple data sources. Email, files, mobile devices, cloud accounts. Custodians change roles, leave the company, or have name changes. Tracking who's who, what they have, and where it is requires systematic management.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Identity Changes:** Custodians marry and change names. Systems still have old names. New searches miss old documents
* **Source Inventory Gaps:** No complete list of what systems, devices, and accounts each custodian uses
* **Status Tracking:** Custodians leave, get reassigned, or go on leave. Their document status needs updating

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process custodian information into managed systems with identity tracking, source inventory, and status management.

### Processing Standards:
* **Identity Management:** All custodian name variations tracked with `Current_Name`, `Former_Names`, `Employee_ID`, `Email_Aliases`, and `Effective_Dates`
* **Source Inventory:** Each custodian's data sources cataloged: `Email_System`, `Network_Drive`, `Local_Drive`, `Mobile_Device`, `Cloud_Accounts`
* **Status Tracking:** Custodian employment status monitored with `Active_Flag`, `Department`, `Manager`, `Start_Date`, and `Termination_Date`

## ROI for E-Discovery Efficiency
Missing custodians means missing documents. Collection from wrong custodians wastes money. Systematic management optimizes the target.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Complete Targeting:** All relevant custodians identified regardless of name changes
2. **Source Coverage:** Complete inventory ensures no data sources overlooked
3. **Status Awareness:** Employment changes trigger appropriate collection or release actions
