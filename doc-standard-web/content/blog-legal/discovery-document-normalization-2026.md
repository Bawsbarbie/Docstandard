# Discovery Document Normalization for Litigation Teams: A 2026 Technical Guide

**"Most litigation teams spend 40% of their discovery phase just trying to read the documents they received. That's not review. That's data janitor work."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Discovery documents arrive in chaos. Scanned PDFs with no OCR, Excel files with merged cells hiding critical data, emails exported as .msg files that don't open properly. When you're dealing with thousands of documents from opposing counsel, inconsistent formatting isn't just annoying. It blocks your entire review workflow.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **OCR Failures:** Scanned depositions with `Deponent_Name` and `Date_Taken` fields buried in image files that can't be searched
* **Metadata Loss:** Native files converted to PDF strip out ` Bates_Number`, `Document_ID`, and `Custodian` tracking information
* **Format Inconsistency:** Emails saved as .msg, .eml, .pdf, and .txt formats across the same production, breaking chronological sorting

## The DocStandard Protocol
We take your raw discovery production and deliver system-ready files. Every document gets normalized to a standard format with extracted metadata mapped to your review platform fields.

### Processing Standards:
* **OCR Layer Addition:** All image-based documents receive searchable text layers with 99%+ accuracy on clean scans
* **Metadata Preservation:** Original `Bates_Start`, `Bates_End`, `Author`, `Date_Created`, and `Date_Modified` fields extracted and mapped to load files
* **Format Standardization:** Email threads converted to consistent PDF/A format with embedded metadata, maintaining `Conversation_Index` for threading

## ROI for Litigation Operations
A typical mid-size case generates 50,000 documents for review. At $150/hour for associate time, formatting cleanup burns through $45,000 before anyone starts actual document review.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Immediate Review Start:** Documents load into Relativity, Logikcull, or Concordance without manual preprocessing
2. **Accurate Search Results:** Properly OCR'd documents with extracted text mean Boolean searches actually return relevant hits
3. **Load File Integrity:** DAT, CSV, and XML load files formatted to your specifications, eliminating import errors
