# Legal Spend Analytics: Cost Intelligence

**"Legal spend is one of the largest unanalyzed cost categories in most companies. Visibility enables management."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Corporate legal spend reaches hundreds of millions annually at large companies. It flows to law firms, vendors, and technology providers through different channels. Most companies know the total but not the breakdown. Spend by matter type, business unit, geographic region, or time period requires weeks of analysis.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Category Ambiguity:** Same type of work categorized differently across invoices and systems. "Employment litigation" vs "Labor dispute" vs "Wrongful termination"
* **Timing Mismatches:** Accrual vs cash accounting. Prepaid retainers vs monthly billing. Month-end cutoffs vary across vendors
* **Currency Complexity:** Multi-national matters involve multiple currencies with exchange rate variations complicating aggregation

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process legal spend data into analyzable formats with category standardization, timing alignment, and currency normalization.

### Processing Standards:
* **Category Mapping:** All spend categorized to uniform taxonomy: `Litigation`, `Regulatory`, `Transactional`, `Advisory`, `IP`, `Employment` with subcategories
* **Timing Normalization:** All transactions converted to accrual basis with `Service_Date`, `Invoice_Date`, and `Payment_Date` preserved for analysis flexibility
* **Currency Standardization:** All amounts converted to reporting currency with `Original_Currency`, `Exchange_Rate`, and `Conversion_Date` tracking

## ROI for Financial Management
Companies that analyze legal spend find 15-25% savings through vendor consolidation, rate negotiation, and efficiency improvements. Analysis requires clean data. Clean data requires processing.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Spend Visibility:** Breakdown by category, vendor, matter, and time period
2. **Trend Analysis:** Historical patterns inform budget forecasting
3. **Benchmark Capability:** Standardized categories enable peer comparison
