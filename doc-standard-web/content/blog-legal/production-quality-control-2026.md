# Production Quality Control: Document Delivery Standards

**"Productions make or break cases. Wrong format, missing documents, or Bates errors create disputes that distract from merits."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Document productions must meet specifications agreed in ESI protocols. PDF vs native. Load file format. Bates numbering. Metadata fields. Productions that don't meet spec get rejected, requiring rework. Productions with errors create disputes about completeness and good faith.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Format Non-Compliance:** Productions delivered as single PDFs per document when natives were required, or vice versa
* **Load File Errors:** DAT files with wrong delimiters, missing columns, or encoding issues that break import
* **Bates Gaps:** Numbering skips or duplicates creating confusion about document count and completeness

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process document productions through specification compliance checking, load file validation, and Bates integrity verification.

### Processing Standards:
* **Specification Compliance:** All production parameters checked against ESI protocol: `Format`, `OCR`, `Metadata_Fields`, `Redaction_Method`
* **Load File Validation:** DAT, CSV, and XML load files checked for delimiter consistency, required columns, and character encoding
* **Bates Integrity:** Complete sequence verified with `Gap_Report` and `Duplicate_Report` generated for any numbering issues

## ROI for Document Production
Rejected productions delay case progress and signal disorganization. Systematic QC prevents rejection and supports professional reputation.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Protocol Compliance:** Spec-compliant productions accepted without challenge
2. **Load File Integrity:** Clean imports into opposing counsel review platforms
3. **Bates Confidence:** Complete, gap-free numbering sequence
