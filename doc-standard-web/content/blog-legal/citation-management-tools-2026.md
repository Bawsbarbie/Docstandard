# Citation Management Tools Integration: Legal Authority Tracking

**"Bad citations kill credibility. One busted cite in a brief undermines every other authority you cite. Courts notice."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Legal briefs contain hundreds of citations. Cases, statutes, regulations, treatises. Each citation needs to be accurate, current, and properly formatted. Manual checking is tedious. Associates skip it or do it hastily. Incorrect citations slip through. Judges and clerks catch them. Credibility suffers.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Format Inconsistency:** Bluebook, ALWD, and local court rules applied inconsistently within the same document
* **Currency Gaps:** Cases cited without checking subsequent history (overruled, questioned, distinguished)
* **Pinpoint Errors:** Page numbers and paragraph cites transcribed incorrectly, sending readers to wrong locations

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process briefs through citation extraction, format verification, and currency checking to ensure authority integrity.

### Processing Standards:
* **Citation Extraction:** All citations identified and parsed into components: `Source_Type`, `Volume`, `Reporter`, `Page`, `Year`, `Pinpoint`
* **Format Verification:** Citations checked against specified style guide (Bluebook 21st, ALWD 6th, local court rules)
* **Currency Checking:** Case citations verified against current reporters with `Subsequent_History` flagged for review

## ROI for Brief Quality
A brief with citation errors signals sloppiness that affects judicial reception of the entire argument. Clean citations support credibility that wins closer calls.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Citation Accuracy:** Format and pinpoint errors caught before filing
2. **Authority Currency:** Overruled and questioned cases flagged for replacement
3. **Style Consistency:** Uniform citation format throughout document
