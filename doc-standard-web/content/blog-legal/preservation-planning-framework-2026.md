# Preservation Planning Framework: Defensible Data Retention

**"Preservation isn't just keeping documents. It's keeping the right documents for the right period with the right documentation."**

## The Legal Data Problem
Legal holds require preserving relevant documents while allowing normal business destruction of irrelevant material. The line is hard to draw. Over-preservation wastes storage and complicates review. Under-preservation risks sanctions. Most organizations lack systematic frameworks for making these decisions.

### Specific Pain Points:
* **Scope Ambiguity:** Holds issued without clear definition of what sources, custodians, and time periods are covered
* **Implementation Gaps:** Hold notices sent but not verified. IT not engaged. Auto-deletion not suspended
* **Release Confusion:** Holds lifted without confirming all relevant matters are concluded

## The DocStandard Protocol
We process preservation planning into documented frameworks with clear scope, implementation checklists, and release protocols.

### Processing Standards:
* **Scope Documentation:** Each hold documented with `Matter_Name`, `Custodian_List`, `Source_Types`, `Date_Range`, and `Key_Terms` for precision
* **Implementation Tracking:** Hold implementation logged with `Notice_Date`, `IT_Ticket_Number`, `Suspension_Confirmation`, and `Acknowledgment_Receipts`
* **Release Protocol:** Hold release process defined with `Release_Criteria`, `Approval_Workflow`, and `Verification_Steps` to prevent premature release

## ROI for Litigation Risk
Preservation failures drive sanctions and adverse inferences. Systematic frameworks reduce failure risk and demonstrate good faith to courts.

### Measurable Benefits:
1. **Scope Clarity:** Precise preservation definition reduces over/under-preservation
2. **Implementation Verification:** Confirmation that holds actually take effect
3. **Release Control:** Prevents premature destruction of potentially relevant materials
