# EORI Number: Economic Operators Registration and Identification Guide

## Hero Section

**Your EU Customs Identity: EORI Registration, Validation & Compliance**

The Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is the unique identifier that EU customs authorities assign to businesses and individuals engaged in customs activities. Introduced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 312/2009, the EORI number uniquely identifies economic operators across all 27 EU member states, replacing previous national identification systems. Without a valid EORI number, businesses cannot import, export, or transit goods through the European Union. DocStandard automates EORI validation, manages registration workflows, and ensures EORI compliance across your EU trade operations.

## Risk Section

### The High Stakes of EORI Non-Compliance

EORI numbers are mandatory for any business involved in importing, exporting, or transit operations within the EU customs territory:

**Operational Impact Statistics:**
- **3+ million active EORI numbers** across the EU
- **100% mandatory** for customs declarations, Entry Summary Declarations (ENS), and Exit Summary Declarations (EXS)
- **Shipment blocking** for invalid or missing EORI numbers
- **Customs declaration rejection** when EORI validation fails
- **€1,000+ penalties** for customs declaration errors including EORI issues
- **Supply chain delays** of 24-72 hours for EORI-related clearance holds

A single invalid EORI number on a customs declaration can block an entire shipment, triggering demurrage charges, missed delivery windows, and contractual penalties.

## Pain Section

### The Hidden Costs of EORI Management

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8">

**Multi-Country Registration Complexity**
Economic operators must register for EORI in each EU member state where they conduct customs activities. Managing registrations across multiple countries—each with different application procedures, timelines, and validation systems—creates administrative overhead that doesn't scale.

**Partner Validation Burden**
EU customs declarations require valid EORI numbers for all parties: importer, exporter, declarant, and sometimes consignee. Validating hundreds of trading partners' EORI numbers against the EU Commission's EORI database is a manual task that invites errors and delays.

**Registration Timing Pressure**
EORI registration can take 3-10 business days depending on the member state. Businesses without advance EORI registration face shipment delays when urgent orders require immediate customs clearance. Rush registration often encounters complications that extend timelines.

## FAQ Section

### EORI Number Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need an EORI number if I'm only importing into one EU country?**
Yes. EORI numbers are mandatory for any customs activity in the EU, regardless of how many member states you operate in. You register once in the member state where you conduct most customs activities, and that EORI is valid across all EU countries.

**How does DocStandard validate EORI numbers?**
Our system connects directly to the EU Commission's EORI database and national business registers to validate EORI numbers in real-time. We verify the format, check active status, and confirm that the registered business name matches your trading partner records.

**Can DocStandard help with EORI registration?**
Absolutely. DocStandard guides you through the EORI registration process with country-specific requirements, generates necessary documentation, and tracks your application with the member state customs authority.

**What happens if my trading partner's EORI is invalid?**
DocStandard alerts you immediately when an EORI validation fails, providing the specific issue (invalid format, not found in database, suspended status). The system recommends next steps: requesting correct EORI from partner, verifying business details, or finding alternative suppliers.

**Do UK businesses need EORI numbers after Brexit?**
UK businesses need an EU EORI number (starting with EU) to import into or export from the EU. UK EORI numbers (starting with GB) are no longer valid for EU customs declarations. DocStandard helps UK businesses obtain the appropriate EU EORI registration.
